## Numbers in Ruby
* Ruby's definition of the modulo (%) operator differs from that of C and Java. In Ruby, -7%3 is 2. In C and Java, the result is -1 instead. In Ruby, the sign of the result (for % operator) is always the same as the sign of the second operand.
## Fun with Strings
* If puts is passed an object that is not a string, puts calls the to_s method of that object and prints the string returned by that method.
* In Ruby, strings are mutable. They can expand as needed, without using much time and memory. Ruby stores a string as a sequence of characters.
